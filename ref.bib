Starting from  a simple calculus D-&lt;: of dependent functions, it adds  records, intersections and recursion to arrive at DOT, a  calculus for dependent object types. The paper shows an  encoding of System F with subtyping in D-&lt;: and  demonstrates the expressiveness of DOT by modeling a range  of Scala constructs in it.},
